                <br> 
                Can describe myself as a person that in love with life, puzzles, space and yellow color. i do believe in technology and want to be a part of it. don’t like universities because they are tooooo slow. Love dogs because of their powerful energy. don’t like summers. learned some lessons while working as a waitress: <br>
                - There are no excuses for being late (just don’t be); <br>
                - Stress resistance is very important for your mental health; <br>
                - Cooperation and communication within the team is extremely important; <br>
                <br>    
                Long story short, I will be very grateful to be a part of your team. </p>
